Description: Joining me in this episode is co- founder and CEO of The 3 million, Nicolas Hatton. The 3 million is the largest campaign organisation for EU citizens in the UK, formed after the 2016 EU referendum to protect the rights of people who have made the UK their home. We discuss promises made to E.U. citizens during the campaign, what the situation has been like for the past 4 years, what it means to need to apply to live in the country you call home and what comes next for the millions of E.U. citizens who want to continue their lives in the U.K. Nicolas discusses important issues around the settled status process and the task of making sure people do not "fall through the cracks"; including "Settled" a new organisation dedicated to tackling this problem going forward.
