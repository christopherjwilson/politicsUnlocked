Description: Joining me in this episode is James Clarke, leader of Renew. Renew is a political party formed in the UK in 2017, by a number of then independent candidates who ran in the 2017 general election. Renew UK was founded,  “because a break-up of our two paralysed parties of government can overcome our utterly dysfunctional politics” and was described in 2018 as “a political party trying to reverse Brexit”. However, James Clarke says Renew are a platform that can bring a broader range of experience and knowledge into politics and I ask him whether "centrism" is a legitimate political position or a comfortable place on the sidelines for people who don't really need change.
