Description: In this episode I talk to Dr Richard Johnson, lecturer in U.S. history at QMUL and author of "The end of the 2nd reconstruction Obama, Trump, and the Crisis of Civil Rights". We discuss the divisions in U.S. politics, the role of courts in U.S. democracy, the electoral college and whether parallels can be drawn between the polarisation that exists in the U.S. and U.K.
