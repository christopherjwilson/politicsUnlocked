PhD, experimental behavioural psychologist. Researcher in decision-making and interested in individual financial behaviour (amongst other things). This podcast is my way of trying to understand more about politics and the political structures and decisions that shape our lives. Open to learning, so tell me where I am wrong and why. Want to hear more from people who are excluded from these types of discussions and people who don't agree, so please reach out.
